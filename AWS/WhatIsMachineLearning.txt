AWS - What is Machine Learning


ML = subset of AI

Uses historical data to predict future outcomes

- make predictions
- optimize utility functions
- extract hidden data structures
- classify data

Fraud detection
1. mine data
2. identify pattern and create labels
3. train model
4. flag transaction as fraudulent

Content Personalization
- Use predictive analytics models to recommend items

Targeted Marketing
- Use prior customer activity to choose the most relevant email campaigns for target customers

Categorization (automated)
- Unstructured content -> Machine Learning model -> Categorized documents

Customer service
- Analyze social media traffic to route customers to customer care specialists


MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPTS

Methods & systems that:
Predict
Extract
Summarize
Optimize
Adapt

Machine Learning types: 
- Unsupervised
- Supervised : Classification & Regression
- Reinforcement


SUPERVISED 

Teaches the model by providing a dataset with example inputs and outputs
Human teacher's expertise is used to tell the model which outputs are correct
Input -> Model -> Output/Prediction
Further grouped into classification and regression

Classification : predicted value = category of true/false
Regression : predicted value = number


UNSUPERVISED

No external teacher or pre-trained data
Model detects emerging properties in the input dataset
Model then constructs patterns or clusters
Further grouped into clustering and association


REINFORCEMENT
Software agent who takes action based on input and based on result of action determines next action to take.
Reward feedback serves as input to learn from its behaviour.
Maximises reward in the long run.


Applications : 
- Based on what you know about the user : Will they use your product?
- Based on what you know about an order : Is this order fraudulent?
- Based on what you know about a news article : What other articles are interesting?


Challenges to Building Smart Applications
- Expertise
- Scaling
- Time to Operationalize


Amazon Machine Learning -> For developers & data scientist who want to focus on building models
Apache Spark on Amazon EMR -> To create managed Apache Spark clusters from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI or the Amazon EMR API


Binary classification : Predicts the answer to a Yes/No question (Is this email spam or not?)
Multiclass classification : Predicts the correct category from a list (What kind of movie is this?)
Regression : Predicts the value of a numeric variable (How many units will be sold?)

1. Train model
2. Evaluate and optimize
3. Retrieve predictions


CASE STUDY - ZILLOW

Challenges:
- provide timely home valuations for all new homes
- perform machine-learning jobs in hours instead of a day
- scale storage and compute capacity on demand

Solution:
- runs Zestimate, Zillow's machine learning-based home-valuation tool on AWS
- gives customes more accurate data on more than 100 million homes
