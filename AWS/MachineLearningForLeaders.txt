AWS - Machine Learning for Leaders


When is Machine Learning an option?
- If the problem is persistent
- If the problem challenges progress or growth
- If the solution needs to scale
- If the problem requires personalization in order to be solved


What does a successful ML solution require?
- People (Software Engineers, Data Engineer, Project Manager, Data Scientist, ...)
- Time
- Cost


Enable ML team/project by asking critical questions:
- What are the made assumptions?
- What is your learning target?
- What type of ML problem is it?
- Why did you choose this algorithm?
- How will you evaluate the model performance?
- How confident are you that you can generalize the results?
